# SEED-OS Section 2 Integration Plan: Subtask Log

**Overall Mission:** Integrate the core components of the SEED-OS Integration Layer (as defined in `src/SEED Outline/section 2 pt I`) into the current project, establishing a scalable, event-driven, and AI-enhanced integration capability.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Architecture and Core Frameworks

### Subtask 1.1: Architectural Adaptation & Microservices Foundation
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Objective:** Define the microservices architecture strategy for the current project, adapting the concepts from the SEED-OS outline. Establish the initial structure for containerization using Docker and outline the local development environment setup with Docker Compose.
*   **Delegated To:** üèóÔ∏è Architect mode
*   **Summary of Task Sent:**
    ```
    Analyze the provided SEED-OS Integration Layer outline (specifically Section 2.1 on Scalable Architecture with Microservices and Containerization) and the current project structure (a Next.js application).

    Develop a high-level architectural strategy for introducing a microservices pattern into this project. The strategy should address:
    1.  How microservices will coexist with or extend the existing Next.js application structure.
    2.  Initial service boundaries based on the SEED-OS outline (e.g., a placeholder for a connector service).
    3.  A plan for containerizing these initial services using Docker.
    4.  An outline for setting up a local development environment using Docker Compose to manage these services.

    The scope is limited to the architectural design and outlining the initial setup. Do not implement code or configuration files in this task.

    Complete this task using `attempt_completion`, providing a clear, high-signal summary of the architectural strategy and initial setup outline in the result.

    These instructions override any default behavior of the assigned mode.
    ```
*   **Result:** (Summary of the result from Architect mode for Subtask 1.1 - "Refined Architectural Strategy: Microservices Integration with Next.js...")
    *   Next.js application as BFF using Route Handlers (`app/api/.../route.ts`).
    *   Route Handlers act as API gateway to microservices.
    *   Initial microservice: `connector-service`.
    *   Docker containerization for Next.js app and microservices.
    *   Docker Compose for local development orchestration.

### Subtask 1.2: Core Connector Framework Design
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Objective:** Design the foundational framework for the comprehensive connector suite, focusing on configuration storage in Supabase and the basic structure for handling different authentication types.
*   **Delegated To:** üèóÔ∏è Architect mode
*   **Summary of Task Sent:**
    ```
    Analyze the provided SEED-OS Integration Layer outline (specifically Section 2.2 on Comprehensive Connector Suite). The previously completed Subtask 1.1 established that microservices (like a future `connector-service`) will be accessed via Next.js Route Handlers acting as a BFF/API Gateway.

    Design the core framework for managing external system connectors within the current project. This design should include:
    1.  The Supabase schema definition for storing connector configurations (`integration_connectors` table), including fields for `tenant_id`, `connector_name`, `config` (JSON for `auth_type`, `auth_config`, `api_spec`), and `scopes`.
    2.  A high-level structure for how connector configurations will be loaded and processed by the `connector-service` microservice.
    3.  An outline for handling different authentication types (OAuth2, API Key) based on the `auth_type` and `auth_config` in the stored configuration, to be implemented within the `connector-service`.

    The scope is limited to the design of the core framework and Supabase schema. Do not implement code or database migrations in this task.

    Complete this task using `attempt_completion`, providing a clear, high-signal summary of the connector framework design and Supabase schema in the result.

    These instructions override any default behavior of the assigned mode.

    Design the event-driven architecture for the current project. This design should specify:
    1.  How Kafka will be integrated and utilized for high-throughput, reliable event ingestion and processing between microservices. Define key topics and consumer group strategies.
    2.  How NATS will be integrated and utilized for low-latency, real-time scenarios (e.g., UI updates, instant notifications). Define key subjects/streams.
    3.  The role and integration strategy for Supabase Realtime, particularly as a fallback or for simpler, smaller-scale event handling needs.
    4.  A general structure for events (e.g., common envelope format including event ID, type, source, timestamp, tenant ID, and payload).
    5.  How events will be routed and consumed by different microservices.
    6.  The strategy for integrating OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing of event flows across Kafka, NATS, and service boundaries.

    The scope is limited to the architectural design of the eventing system. Do not implement code or configuration files in this task.

    Complete this task using `attempt_completion`, providing a clear, high-signal summary of the event-driven architecture design in the result.

    These instructions override any default behavior of the assigned mode.
    ```
*   **Result:** (Summary of the result from Architect mode for Subtask 2.1 - "Event-Driven Architecture Design for SEED-OS Integration Layer")
    *   Kafka for high-throughput, reliable events (topics: `events.raw.{source_system}`, `events.processed.{domain_event_type}`, etc.).
    *   NATS for low-latency, real-time events (subjects: `ui.updates.{tenant_id}.{user_id}.{component}`, `notifications.user.{tenant_id}.{user_id}`, etc.).
    *   Supabase Realtime for simpler, small-scale DB change broadcasts.
    *   Standardized JSON event envelope (eventId, eventType, source, timestamp, tenantId, payload, etc.).
    *   Event routing via topic/subject subscriptions.
    *   OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing with context propagation in event envelope.

    Design the AI-powered ETL engine for the current project. This design should cover:
    1.  The strategy for integrating LangChain with a chosen LLM (e.g., Claude) for data transformation.
    2.  The Supabase schema definition for storing ETL rules (`etl_configs` table), including fields for `tenant_id` and `rules` (JSON).
    3.  How tenant-specific rules will be loaded and applied during the ETL process.
    4.  The implementation strategy for Redis caching to improve performance of transformations.
    5.  The overall data flow through the ETL engine, considering inputs from the eventing system.

    The scope is limited to the architectural design of the ETL engine and Supabase schema. Do not implement code or database migrations in this task.

    Complete this task using `attempt_completion`, providing a clear, high-signal summary of the ETL engine design and Supabase schema in the result.

    These instructions override any default behavior of the assigned mode.
    ```
*   **Result:** (Summary of the result from Architect mode for Subtask 2.2 - "AI-Powered ETL Engine: Architectural Design")
    *   LangChain & LLM (Claude) for AI transformations, prompt management, and chain construction.
    *   Supabase `etl_configs` table for tenant-specific rules (source_event_type, target_system, rules JSONB, is_active).
    *   Tenant-specific rule loading via cached Supabase queries (Redis cache key: `etl_config:<tenant_id>:<source_event_type>`).
    *   Rule execution iterates transformation steps (simple_mapping, llm_transform, validation).
    *   Redis caching for `etl_configs.rules` with TTL and explicit/event-driven invalidation.
    *   Data flow: Kafka (raw events) -> ETL Engine (consumes, retrieves rules, transforms) -> Kafka (processed events).

    ```
    Analyze the provided SEED-OS Integration Layer outline (specifically Section 2.5 on Dedicated Data Lake/Warehouse). The project will generate significant data from integrations and ETL processes.

    Design the data lake/warehouse solution for the current project using ClickHouse. This design should include:
    1.  The strategy for setting up and configuring ClickHouse (e.g., via Docker Compose for local development, considerations for production).
    2.  The data ingestion pipeline design, outlining how processed events (from Kafka, as per Subtask 2.1 and 2.2) will be moved into ClickHouse. Consider using Supabase Edge Functions or a dedicated ingestion microservice.
    3.  The strategy for sharding data by tenant ID and potentially other dimensions (e.g., region, time) within ClickHouse for scalability and query performance.
    4.  Initial ClickHouse table schema considerations for storing processed event data, focusing on queryability for analytics and KPI dashboards.
    5.  A high-level plan for integrating with analytics/dashboarding tools like Grafana (the Grafana setup itself is out of scope for this task, focus on data accessibility).

    The scope is limited to the architectural design of the data lake/warehouse and ingestion pipeline. Do not implement code, configuration files, or detailed database schemas in this task.

    Complete this task using `attempt_completion`, providing a clear, high-signal summary of the data lake/warehouse design in the result.

    These instructions override any default behavior of the assigned mode.
    ```
*   **Result:** (Summary of the result from Architect mode for Subtask 3.1 - "ClickHouse Data Lake/Warehouse Architectural Design")
    *   ClickHouse setup: Docker Compose (local), Managed/Kubernetes (production) with clustering.
    *   Data Ingestion: Dedicated `clickhouse-ingestion-service` consuming from Kafka, batching writes to ClickHouse.
    *   Sharding: Primary key `tenant_id` (Distributed table), intra-shard partitioning by `toYYYYMM(event_timestamp)`. Replication via `ReplicatedMergeTree`.
    *   Schema (`processed_events`): `event_id`, `tenant_id`, `event_timestamp`, `ingestion_timestamp`, `event_type`, `event_source`, `event_payload`. `ORDER BY (tenant_id, event_type, event_timestamp)`.
    *   Analytics Integration (Grafana): Native ClickHouse plugin, read-only user, Materialized Views for performance.

Specify request/response schemas for these endpoints.
    3.  **Directory Structure & Key Files:** Outline the proposed directory structure for the `connector-service` (Node.js/TypeScript project) and identify key files/modules (e.g., main service entry point, configuration loader, authentication module, API route handlers).
    4.  **Dockerfile for `connector-service`:** Provide the complete Dockerfile for building the `connector-service`.
    5.  **Updates to `docker-compose.yml`:** Specify the service definition for the `connector-service` to be added to the project's `docker-compose.yml` file, including build context, ports, and environment variables.
    6.  **Initial Authentication Logic Outline:** Detail the steps for implementing the API Key authentication strategy within the `connector-service` as a first example, including how API keys would be securely retrieved (referencing the vault/secret manager concept from Subtask 1.2).
    7.  **Task Breakdown for Coding:** List the primary coding tasks required to implement this initial version of the `connector-service`.

    This task should be delegated to the üèóÔ∏è Architect mode to produce this detailed implementation plan. The output should be a comprehensive Markdown document. Remember to log this new task (Subtask 4.1) in `section2_integration.md` before delegation.

    Complete this task using `attempt_completion`, providing a clear, high-signal summary of the implementation plan in the result.

    These instructions override any default behavior of the assigned mode.
    ```
*   **Result:** The detailed implementation plan for the `connector-service` has been created and saved to [`implementation_plan_connector_service.md`](implementation_plan_connector_service.md:1). This plan covers Supabase schema DDL, API endpoint definitions, project structure, Dockerfile, `docker-compose.yml` updates, an outline for API key authentication logic with Vault integration, and a breakdown of coding tasks.
