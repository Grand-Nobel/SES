# SES Section 7 Implementation Log

This document tracks the tasks and subtasks involved in implementing Section 7: Multi-Tenancy, Security & Compliance of the SES system outline.

## Main Task: Implement Section 7: Multi-Tenancy, Security & Compliance

**Purpose:** To define the SES systemâ€™s multi-tenant architecture, role-based access controls, data isolation mechanisms, compliance enforcement, and data handling policies for secure and privacy-compliant operation across all business clients.

### Subtask 1: Implement Database Tenant Isolation and RBAC via RLS

**Status:** Planned (Attempted delegation, user requested logging first)
**Description:** Implement the database-level aspects of tenant isolation and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) based on sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the outline. This includes adding `tenant_id` columns and defining RLS policies.
**Mode:** Code
**Outcome:** Delegation attempted, user requested task logging before proceeding.

## Implementation Plan

- **Subtask 1: Implement Database Tenant Isolation and RBAC via RLS**
  - **Status:** Planned
  - **Description:** Implement the core database-level enforcement using PostgreSQL RLS, including adding `tenant_id` columns to relevant tables and defining RLS policies based on JWT claims (`tenant_id`, `role`, `user_id`). Address RLS for `pgvector` if used within PostgreSQL.
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.1 (Database Isolation), 7.2 (RBAC Enforcement via RLS)

- **Subtask 2: Implement Vector Database Isolation**
  - **Status:** Completed
  - **Description:** Implement tenant isolation for the Vector DB layer. This involves using dedicated namespaces for Pinecone or ensuring `tenant_id` filtering is enforced for `pgvector` (if not fully covered by RLS in Subtask 1).
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.1 (Vector DB Isolation)

- **Subtask 3: Implement Redis Streams Isolation**
  - **Status:** Completed
  - **Description:** Implement the chosen shared streams model for Redis, ensuring event payloads include `tenant_id` and that consumers (Orchestrator, Runners) correctly filter events based on the tenant ID in the payload.
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.1 (Redis Streams Isolation)

- **Subtask 4: Implement Authentication & Token Scoping**
  - **Status:** Planned
  - **Description:** Implement authentication and token scoping by creating a `profiles` table in the `public` schema to store user roles and other custom data. Link this table to `auth.users`. Update the authentication flow (`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) to fetch the user's role from the `profiles` table after successful authentication and include it in the JWT/session. Modify the `public.get_current_role()` function to query the `profiles` table based on `auth.uid()` to retrieve the user's role for RLS enforcement. Address the incorrect migration that attempted to modify `auth.users`.
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.2 (Enforcement via JWT), 7.3 (Authentication & Token Scoping), 7.8 (Scoped Execution, Temporal Access Windows)

- **Subtask 5: Implement Secure Configuration Management**
  - **Status:** Completed
  - **Description:** Integrate with an external Secrets Manager for app-wide secrets. Implement the `tenant_config` PostgreSQL table with `pgcrypto` encryption for sensitive per-tenant configurations (like external API keys). Define how infrastructure config and agent configs are managed securely.
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.4 (Secure Config Management), 7.7 (Baseline Encryption)

- **Subtask 6: Implement Audit Logging & Forensics**
  - **Status:** Planned
  - **Description:** Design and implement the database tables for `agent_logs`, `system_logs`, and `audit_logs`. Ensure `trace_id` propagation across services. Define key log fields and implement the configurable retention policy, including planning for archiving to lower-cost storage.
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.5 (Audit Logging & Forensics), 7.8 (Audit Everything)

- **Subtask 7: Implement PII Handling & Encryption**
  - **Status:** Planned
  - **Description:** Create and maintain the PII Classification Registry. Implement `pgcrypto` encryption for sensitive fields in the database (if not covered in Subtask 5). Ensure sensitive PII is masked or redacted in logs and appropriately handled (redacted, pseudonymized, or excluded) when interacting with external LLMs based on the registry and compliance requirements. Enforce TLS for all external communication.
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.7 (PII Handling & Encryption), 7.6 (Third-Party AI Compliance, Data Residency - LLM routing), 7.8 (Transport Security)

- **Subtask 8: Implement Zero-Trust Architecture Enforcement (Code/Config)**
  - **Status:** Planned
  - **Description:** Implement technical controls to enforce Zero-Trust principles not covered in other subtasks, such as default deny policies (beyond RLS), mutual authentication (mTLS) or signed requests for internal service communication, and verification steps for access requests.
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.8 (Zero-Trust Architecture Enforcement)

- **Subtask 9: Implement Admin Controls & Approvals (Code/UI)**
  - **Status:** Planned
  - **Description:** Implement the UI workflows and backend logic for Admin review and approval of configuration changes (prompts, agent learning config). Implement restricted access controls for sensitive logs and user management features based on RBAC. Enforce MFA for privileged roles.
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.9 (Admin Controls & Approvals)

- **Subtask 10: Plan and Document Red Teaming & Penetration Readiness**
  - **Status:** Planned
  - **Description:** Detail the procedures and methodologies for proactive security testing, including LLM security testing (prompt injection, data leakage), infrastructure testing (RLS robustness, API bypass), abuse/DoS protection testing (rate limiting, bot protection, brute-force), and session management security testing (token revocation). This subtask focuses on planning and documentation rather than direct code implementation.
  - **Relevant Sections:** 7.10 (Red Teaming & Penetration Readiness)

- **Subtask 11: Implement Data Residency & Compliance Support (Code/Infra Config)**
  - **Status:** Planned
  - **Description:** Implement the technical mechanisms to support data residency, including configuring regional deployments for databases, vector stores, and object storage. Implement logic for routing requests (especially to external LLMs) to region-specific endpoints. Ensure the architecture provides the technical capabilities required by the compliance procedures documented separately (e.g., supporting data subject requests, consent management). Implement the Compliance Escalation Mode logic.
