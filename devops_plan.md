        - [ ] Dependency Auditing: Automated scanning (npm audit, pip safety, trivy fs, Snyk, Dependabot); fail builds on critical vulnerabilities; SBOM validation.
        - [ ] Base Image Validation: Verify base images from approved registries, check vulnerabilities.
        - [ ] Artifact Signing & Verification: Sign images/outputs (Cosign, KMS/hardware tokens, Fulcio, Rekor); mandatory verification.
        - [ ] Approved Vendor Registry: Internal artifact repository proxies approved external libraries; security vetting for new libraries.
        - [ ] CI Access Control: Least-privilege IAM roles, restricted network access, isolated environments for sensitive stages.
    - [ ] **8.8.4 Authentication & Authorization Hardening**
        - [ ] JWT & Token Security: Short-lived access tokens, longer refresh tokens (secure storage), rotation/revocation (revocation list, forced refresh).
        - [ ] Signature & Claims Validation: Asymmetric signing (RS256/ES256), public keys via JWKS, strict validation of standard/custom claims.
        - [ ] Misuse Detection: Monitor auth logs/API patterns for anomalies (rapid token reuse, IP/geolocation shifts); integrate with UEBA tools.
        - [ ] Platform Hardening: Admin MFA (WebAuthn, TOTP), optional IP-Based Access Controls, Session Intelligence (anomaly flagging), Brute Force Protection (rate limiting, CAPTCHA, account lockout).

### 8.9 Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan
- [ ] Implement a comprehensive Disaster Recovery plan.
    - [ ] **8.9.1 Recovery Objectives**
        - [ ] Define RTO/RPO targets based on component criticality: Auth, API Gateway, Core DB (< 1 hour RTO, < 5 min RPO); Agent Runners, Orchestrator (< 4 hours RTO, < 15 min RPO); Vector DB (< 4 hours RTO, < 1 hour RPO); Analytics & Reporting (< 12 hours RTO, < 1 hour RPO); Event Bus (< 1 hour RTO, < 5 min RPO).
    - [ ] **8.9.2 DR Architecture**
        - [ ] Deployment Model: Warm Standby in designated DR region (IaC provisioned core infra, GitOps for services).
        - [ ] Cross-Region DB Sync: Asynchronous streaming replication for PostgreSQL (Patroni, pgBackRest WAL archives); monitor lag (< 60 seconds).
        - [ ] Secrets & Config Sync: Cross-region replication for secrets (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault); Git for critical configs.
        - [ ] Traffic Control: DNS-based failover (AWS Route 53 health checks, weighted/latency-based routing).
    - [ ] **8.9.3 Failover & Failback Procedures**
        - [ ] Automated runbooks (Ansible Tower, Rundeck, custom scripts) for sequences.
        - [ ] Failover Trigger Sequence: Monitoring detects outage, SRE/DR team validates, runbook initiates DR failover (DB promotion), updates DNS, scales up services, runs synthetic tests, sends notifications.
        - [ ] Failback Sequence (Planned): Primary region repaired, runbook initiates data resynchronization, controlled traffic shift via DNS weighting, demotes DR DB, scales down DR services.
        - [ ] Post-Incident Automation: Auto-generate draft postmortem, attach relevant data (Grafana snapshots, logs, alerts, CI/CD info), tag monitoring data with incident ID.
    - [ ] **8.9.4 DR Testing Regimen**
        - [ ] Quarterly: Tabletop exercises.
        - [ ] Semi-Annually: Partial failover tests in staging/pre-prod.
        - [ ] Annually: Full DR simulation (core services failover, DB failover, traffic redirection, functional validation, failback).
        - [ ] Metrics Logged: RTO/RPO achieved, manual interventions, runbook execution time, post-failover error rates, monitoring effectiveness.
