# ERP Add-on Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to add an ERP add-on to the application, starting with integration with Oracle ERP.

## Objective

Enable the SEED system and its agents to connect to existing ERP services used by businesses, view ERP data, create analysis reports, automate workflows, and learn from the ERP data.

## Initial Focus: Oracle ERP Integration

The first phase of this project will focus on integrating with Oracle ERP.

## Plan Steps

1.  **Develop Comprehensive Oracle Connector:**
    *   **Goal:** Implement a connector within the `connector-service` (`my-nextjs-app/connector-service`) capable of fetching a wide range of data from Oracle ERP.
    *   **Details:** Research Oracle ERP APIs (REST, SOAP) or other integration methods. Write code to handle authentication and data retrieval based on the needs for reporting, automation, and learning. Leverage the `packages/connector-sdk` if it provides a suitable framework.

2.  **Enhance Data Synchronization:**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the system can effectively synchronize the comprehensive data fetched from Oracle ERP.
    *   **Details:** Adapt the synchronization process to handle the volume and variety of Oracle data. Integrate the data flow to feed the fetched data into the RAG pipeline.

3.  **Refine RAG Pipeline and Agents:**
    *   **Goal:** Adapt the RAG pipeline and agent logic to effectively process, analyze, and learn from the diverse Oracle data.
    *   **Details:** Modify the RAG pipeline (`my-nextjs-app/src/lib/agents/ragPipeline.ts`) and agent implementations to improve data parsing, indexing strategies, and agent capabilities for identifying relevant data points for reporting and automation based on the comprehensive ERP data.

4.  **Build UI for Oracle Connection:**
    *   **Goal:** Create user interface components within the Next.js application (`my-nextjs-app`) to allow users to securely configure their Oracle ERP connection.
    *   **Details:** Develop forms and workflows for users to input connection details, authenticate, and manage their Oracle ERP integration.

5.  **Implement Reporting, Automation, and Learning Features:**
    *   **Goal:** Develop the specific functionalities that leverage the processed Oracle data.
    *   **Details:** Build features for generating analysis reports based on ERP data, implementing workflow automation triggered by ERP events or data, and enabling agents to learn patterns and insights from the integrated data.

## Next Steps

Upon user approval and switching to ACT MODE, the first step will be to begin the development of the Comprehensive Oracle Connector (Step 1).
